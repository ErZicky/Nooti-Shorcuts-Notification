✨​ Nooti's goal to give users a minimal and clean way to reach their favorites apps, contacts or website without cluttering their phone home in the leasst invasive way possible by giving the possibility of creating a notification with shortcusts to such apps. Nooti is functional and aesthetically pleasing at the same time


📱 📞 🌐  App, Contacts & websites these are the 3 things, at the moment, you can put as shortcuts. Nooti will also try to fetch a favicon for the website

🎨 Custom Icon Pack Support: you can use third-party icon packs currently installed to style your shortcuts to better match your phone style. If the pack has the right icon, Nooti will use it for the apps shortcuts!

Additionally, the settings panel provides convenient access to various useful resources, such as links to my other apps, a feedback button, credits etc...


📶​ Nooti can work perfectly offline and does not need internet functionality (internet is used only to retrive the websites icons for their shortcuts but can work without internet too)

🔍 Accessible by All: Nooti is fully labeled and compatible with screen reading software, ensuring a seamless experience for users who rely on accessibility features.
